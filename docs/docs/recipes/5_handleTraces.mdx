# Handle traces

[Behind the scenes](/docs/quickstart/principle) every operator reports in detail its activity to the runtime. Then the runtime broadcast all the activity reporting to a trace stream.

The activity that is reported to the runtime to be issued into into the trace stream are the following

- The end of the stream by giving the number of events that went thought it
- If applicable, the exception that occurred in the operator
- If `UseDetailedTraces` has been flagged, the actual payload/output of the operator is transmitted as well.

The process to apply to this trace stream can be given to the runtime when triggering the execution of the main process.

```cs {4}
var processRunner = StreamProcessRunner.Create<string>(DefineProcess);
var executionOptions = new ExecutionOptions<string> 
{ 
    TraceProcessDefinition = (ts, cs) => ts.Do("Show trace on console", t => Console.WriteLine(t.ToString())) 
};
var res = await processRunner.ExecuteAsync(args[0], executionOptions);
```

Actually the trace process definition should be defined in a dedicated function:

```cs {13}
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Paillave.Etl.Core;

namespace Tutorial
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var processRunner = StreamProcessRunner.Create<string>(DefineProcess);
            var executionOptions = new ExecutionOptions<string>
            {
                TraceProcessDefinition = DefineTraceProcess
            };
            var res = await processRunner.ExecuteAsync(args[0], executionOptions);
        }
        private static void DefineTraceProcess(IStream<TraceEvent> traceStream, ISingleStream<string> contentStream)
        {
            // TODO: define how to process traces here
        }
        private static void DefineProcess(ISingleStream<string> contextStream)
        {
            // TODO: define the process here
        }
    }
}
```

The stream to handle traces emits `TraceEvent` payloads.

ITraceContent-->TraceLevel:Level
StreamTraceContentBase--|>ITraceContent
CounterSummaryStreamTraceContent--|>StreamTraceContentBase
RowProcessStreamTraceContent--|>StreamTraceContentBase
UnhandledExceptionStreamTraceContent--|>StreamTraceContentBase`}/>

To be able to receive events with a content of type `RowProcessStreamTraceContent`, the flag `UseDetailedTraces` must be set as for performance purposes, it is not emitted by default:

```cs {5}
var processRunner = StreamProcessRunner.Create<string>(DefineProcess);
var executionOptions = new ExecutionOptions<string> 
{ 
    TraceProcessDefinition = (ts, cs) => ts.Do("Show trace on console", t => Console.WriteLine(t.ToString())),
    UseDetailedTraces = true
};
var res = await processRunner.ExecuteAsync(args[0], executionOptions);
```

It is possible to do whatever is possible in a trace process, even saving things in a database. As it can happen that the target database for logging is not the same than the working database. This can be the same for anything else that is injected: if the dependency injection context needs to be different than the one for the main process, it needs to be mentioned in `TraceResolver`.

```cs {10}
var processRunner = StreamProcessRunner.Create<string>(DefineProcess);
using (var cnx = new SqlConnection(args[1]))
using (var tracesCnx = new SqlConnection(args[2]))
{
    cnx.Open();
    var executionOptions = new ExecutionOptions<string>
    {
        TraceProcessDefinition = DefineTraceProcess
        Resolver = new SimpleDependencyResolver().Register(cnx),
        TraceResolver = new SimpleDependencyResolver().Register(tracesCnx),
    };
    var res = await processRunner.ExecuteAsync(args[0], executionOptions);
    Console.Write(res.Failed ? "Failed" : "Succeeded");
}
```

A concrete example of trace process is described in the [related tutorial](/docs/tutorials/trackAndCheck#catch-main-events-to-save-them-in-a-log-file).
